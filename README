Abstract

This library include some light tools for UIKit and simple extension of Apple Cocoa or UIKit.

Because this library is started from just a file, it don't look well-organized.
But this is helpful enough for small project.


Lisence

Most of this library is GPL v3. See COPYING for GPL v3 details.
If you want to use this library as GPL v3, read this section carefully

1. ICSqlite3 is following sqlite3 lisence. As like it, I disclaims copyright to ICSqlite3.h and ICSqlite3.m. See below for details

**THIS LISENCE IS NOT COMPATABLE WITH GPLv3**

**THIS LISENCE IS NOT COMPATABLE WITH GPLv3**

You should not use ICCoverFlowView.* for GPL v3. This lisence is BSD-like one and cannot be distributed as GPL v3.
Any other part of this library do not have dependency to this files and will notdo so.
This files have dependency to ICUtility.* and I allow GPL-free-use of ICUtility.* for ICCoverFlowView.*

How to use

1. Compiled library
	THIS IS NEVER TESTED ON OSX.
	1. build project
	2. add 'include' to 'header search path'
	3. add IdealUIKit target as dependency
	4. add '-force_load <path_for_libIdealUIKit.a> to 'other linker flags'
		If you don't use any features about category, skip this
		This is bug of linker for non-i386 archietecture
2. Directy source
	1. add files what you need to your project
	2. add Foundation.h ( and UIKit.h for iOS ) to prefix header
	This way may help you to reduce complex jobs


Common Terms

* AbstractPath: If path include protocol prefix, it is processed by dynamic checker. 'http://', 'https://', 'res://' available
* cachedSomething: This method provides ICCache abstraction. If path pointing remote resource, it would be cached by ICCache policy.
* Other terms are following apple guidelines.
